# BMP280

**Measure temperature and air pressure with a BMP280 chip and an ESP microcontroller**

The BMP280 is an inexpensive chip to measure temperature and air pressure (barometer). Connecting the BMP280 to an ESP microcontroller over I2C and set it up with ESPHome is quite easy.

State (2023.04): Measurements of temperature and air pressure looking good

## Connections

Connect the ESP microcontroller (ESP32 and ESP8266 will work) to the BMP280 over I2C with four wires:

| ESP | BMP280 | |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 3V3 | VCC | don't use 5V here! |
| GND | GND |
| GPIO22 | SCL |
| GPIO21 | SDA |

## Accuracy Estimation

As I have a cheap chinese board with a (probably clone) BMP280 chip, I wanted to have a look at the accuracy ...

The Bosch BMP280 datasheet lists **+-1 hPa and +-1°C (at 0~65°C)** as the absolute accuracy.

### Example Temperature Measurement

Measured value from the BMP280: **19.5 °C**.

Measured value of LYWSD03MMC: 19.1 °C -> **difference: 0.4 °C** :-)

The measured temperature value was well within the accuracy range of another thermometer (Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC) in the room.

### Example Air Pressure Measurement

Measured value from the BMP280: **981.6 hPa**.

The "official" air pressure value at Nürnberg (Airport): **1018 hPa**

I found out, that this "official" value has it's reference to sea level, while the measured value obviously has a reference to Nürnberg at 309m above sea level. To get the measured value also to the sea "reference" level, 38 hPa must be added:

981.6 hPa + 38 hPa = 1019.6 hPa -> **difference: 1,6 hPa** :-|

The difference is a bit higher than the +-1 hPa accuracy from the datasheet. As I don't know the accuracy of the official values, the difference may even be within the accuracy range.

### Air Pressure Reference

Official pressure values at the Nürnberg airport - a few kilometres away from me (german): http://umweltdaten.nuernberg.de/wetterdaten/messstation-nuernberg-flugfeld/luftdruck/bereich/Tages-Ansicht.html
Pressure difference of 38 hPa between sea level and Nürnberg level (german): http://umweltdaten.nuernberg.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Parameter/wetter_luftdruck.pdf

### Conclusion

It seems the measured values should be ok for hobbyists use. Long term reliability and accuracy still needs to be evaluated ...
