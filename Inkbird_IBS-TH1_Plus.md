# Inkbird IBS-TH1 Plus

Temperature and humidity sensor with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), LCD and a waterproof temperature probe.

*State (2023.02): As the Bluetooth update rate and measured values seems unreliable in my Home Assistant, I regard this one as a fail for me. A test with the corresponding Engbird Android App works fine. So this seems to be a problem with ESPHome/HA.*
