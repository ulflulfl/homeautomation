*Back side with the two very small holes (bottom right) for RESET and LED. The two rubber areas prevent slipping*

The LED will blink shortly on every action (push or turn).

### Join mode

The knob will be in Zigbee "join mode" at first start.

To trigger the "join mode" again: Push into the "RESET" hole at the back with a thin wire for a few seconds until LED blinks. If the LED stops blinking after a few seconds without any intervention or Zigbee joining, the battery may be low. Don't push the wire into the LED hole :-)

### Battery

Battery life: I had to replace the battery two months after first setup. Don't know if that was a bad battery or if the device "eats" batteries. Time will tell ...

Battery replacement: Remove screw, remove back lid, replace CR2032

After replacing the battery, the LED was flashing all the time and pressing "RESET" or enabling join mode in Zigbee2MQTT didn't help. I thought the knob just died. After I restarted Zigbee2MQTT the knob suddenly worked again.

## Zigbee2MQTT

The knob was automatically detected and configured.

A description can be found at: https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/ERS-10TZBVK-AA.html There are two modes of the knob which can be confusing, see section: "Device operation" at the linked page.
