## Music Assistant

I'm pretty new to Music Assistant and wanted to play music for intense listening, but that caused some effort ...

How I do stuff with Music Assistant:

* [Media Player used](media_player.md) - Ikea (Sonos) and ESPHome DIY media players I've tried
* [Audio Library Editing](audio_library_editing.md) - tools I use to edit the audio library, especially metadata tags and file formats
* TODO: audio library structure / tags used
