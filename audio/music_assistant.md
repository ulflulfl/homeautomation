## Music Assistant

I'm pretty new to Music Assistant and wanted to play music for intense listening, but that caused some effort ...

How I do stuff with Music Assistant:

Audio library:

* [Audio Library Editing](audio_library_editing.md) - tools I use to edit the audio library, especially metadata tags and file formats
* TODO: audio library structure / tags used

Media player:

* [Media Player Experiments](./Media_Player_Experiments.md) - Ikea (Sonos) and ESPHome DIY media players I've tried
* [Home Assistant Media Player](./home_assistant_media_player.md) - Connect a Home Assistant Media Player to Music Assistant
* [PCM5102A](./PCM5102A_Media_Player.md) - DIY media player with PCM5102A and ESP32 (DAC only)
* [MAX98357_Media_Player](./MAX98357_Media_Player.md) - DIY media player with MAX98357 (mono DAC, ~3W amplifier), sound quality limited
* [I2S and ESP32](./I2S_and_ESP32.md) - basic DIY I2S for ESP32 infos (e.g. available chips)
